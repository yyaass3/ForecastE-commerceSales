# ForecastE-commerceSales dataset is from an online retailer and covers orders from multiple countries over a year and includes a variety of variables like invoice numbers, stock codes, quantities, and unit prices.
My analyze on this dataset includes to steps:
The input:
The input file in my project contains the data analyzing code using python:
1. To bring better insights, I have made this dataset clean by removing nulls and outliers using box and scatter plot
2. now by using the clean data, i made a class which includes functions that can analyze the trades and sold goods based on countries.
this process obtains:
The Number of Trades for each country, The Total Trades for each Good of each country, The Most Traded Good in each country, The Sold Quantity for each Good, The Total Profit for each Good in each country and The Total profit earned for each country.
3. charts are the next section of my analysis: kd plot to see the probability distribution, line plot to show the changes and scatter plot also
4. and the last thing to do is runing the code in a text file.

The output:
for the output part, i made the code limited to united kingdom as the country and country as the column name to be counted, also i limited the result to 10 sample.
The output includes:
1- First and Last 5 rows as sample, also data information and description
2- Analyzing the sold good based on their country, quantity and price

wish the project be insightful to you.
